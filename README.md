# Experience Marketplace

A marketplace web app where people **sell experiences** and others **book them**.
For example, one user lists "Drive a Lamborghini for 30 minutes," and another user
finds it, picks a date, and reserves it.

## Core Idea

| Role     | What they can do                                                        |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Host** | Create, edit, and remove experiences they offer (title, description, price, location, available dates, capacity) |
| **Guest**| Browse and search experiences, view details, and make reservations      |
| Any user | Register, log in, and manage their profile and reservations             |

A user can be a host and a guest at the same time.

## Tech Stack

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 4.1** (Web MVC, Data JPA, Validation)
- **H2**: in-memory database for development, with a web console
- **Maven**: builds the project (a wrapper is included)

## Domain Model (planned)

```
User 1 ──── * Product (Experience)      a host offers many experiences
User 1 ──── * Reservation               a guest makes many reservations
Product 1 ── * Reservation              an experience has many bookings
```

### `User`

### `Product` (an Experience)
- `id`, `title`, `description`, `price`, `location`, `durationMinutes`,
  `capacity`, `host` (→ User), `createdAt`

### `Reservation`
- `id`, `product` (→ Product), `guest` (→ User), `date`, `participants`,
  `status` (`PENDING`, `CONFIRMED`, `CANCELLED`), `totalPrice`, `createdAt`
